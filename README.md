# Activity-4-Search-Destroy

In this task, you will use sensors and actuators and  achieve a simple robotic task

Task
Attach an object sensor to the mobile robot platform built and programmed in Activity 3.
1) Study the sensitivity of the sonar sensor to different object (i.e. material and surface)
2) Identify a suitable threshold value to detect an object (i.e. water bottle)

Program your robot as follows:
- Robot should start or stop based on sound.
- Move inside a 60cm x 60cm play area. Note: Both differential tire should not cross the black tape border.
- Detect an object inside the play area and push the object outside of the play area within 30 seconds
